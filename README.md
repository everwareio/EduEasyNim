# EduEasy

EduEasy is a simple tool that aids in the construction of large amounts of worksheet style questions for teachers, so they can spend less time writing questions and solutions, and more time interacting with students and responding to class requests.

Currently has generators for:

  1. Simple Quadratics, in the form x^2 + bx + c
  2. Advanced Quadratics, in the form ax^2 + bx + c
  3. Simple differentiation, in the form ax^b
  4. Differentiation with a constant, in the form ax^b + c
